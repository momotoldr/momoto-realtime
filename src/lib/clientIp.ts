/**
 * The visitor's address, for every per-IP rate limit.
 *
 * Behind Cloudflare, `req.ip` is the wrong answer whatever `TRUST_PROXY` says. Requests go
 * visitor → Cloudflare → Railway's edge → this process, and on 2026-10-01 a diagnostic in
 * momoto-analytics showed that the `X-Forwarded-For` reaching us holds two infrastructure
 * addresses and **not the visitor's at all** (forged values sent by a client were dropped,
 * too). So `trust proxy` 1 gave Railway's edge and 2 gave a Cloudflare server — either way
 * many visitors shared one rate-limit bucket.
 *
 * Cloudflare puts the visitor's address in `CF-Connecting-IP` on every request it forwards,
 * so with `CLIENT_IP_HEADER=cf-connecting-ip` that header wins. It is only as trustworthy
 * as the route in: a request that skips Cloudflare (a `*.up.railway.app` domain) could set
 * it to anything and mint itself a fresh bucket per request — so keep the service reachable
 * through the Cloudflare domain only. A missing or malformed header falls back to `req.ip`.
 *
 * Duplicated in momoto-core, momoto-realtime and momoto-analytics on purpose (no shared
 * package between services).
